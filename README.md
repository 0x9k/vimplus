vimplus: An automatic configuration program for vim
===============================================


Intro
-----

I usually use vim to write a C++ program, so in order to allow me to write C ++ more enjoyable, I made some vim automatically configured, the following I will be a presentation of my vimplus.

Configuration ycm
------------

Run the `install.sh` script after the installation is complete, `HOME` directory will exist [.ycm_extra_conf.py][23] and `.vimrc`, the file is YCM implement C++ and other languages syntax completion function profile, I would put a general in the `HOME` directory, then copy `each project` a [.ycm_extra_conf.py][24],**don't** just copy/paste that file somewhere and expect things to magically work; **your project needs different flags**. Hint: just replace the strings in the `flags` variable with compilation flags necessary for your project. That should be enough for 99% of projects.

Features
------------

### Syntax completion

[YouCompleteMe][25] plugin provides syntax completion function, and YouCompleteMe is a fast, as-you-type, fuzzy-search code completion engine for Vim.

### <span id="Warning">**Warning**</span>

 1. If poor network conditions may fail to install, basically [Valloric/YouCompleteMe][28] installation fails, after a failed installation will need to `rm -rf ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe`, and then re-execute the `install.sh` can be re-installed, the program will automatically install the plug-in installation fails,**or I have** [YouCompleteMe.tar.gz][29],download it and then `tar -xvf YouCompleteMe.tar.gz -C ~/.vim/bundle/`,then `cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe` and run `python ./install.py --clang-completer`.
 2. In `ubuntu16.04LTS` installation may fail([Valloric/YouCompleteMe][30] installation fails), **because vim default support for plug python3 compiled**, after a failed installation, manually `cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe`, then run `python3 ./install.py --clang-completer`.
